Static site generators (SSGs) are very useful programs which enable people to easily populate websites with multiple static webpages by using, for example, pre-defined layout templates and CSS preprocessors. Once the templates are created, webpages can be quickly built using html and markdown files to add content to the templates.

So why doesn’t everyone use these wonderful SSGs? The thing is, SSGs have their limitations and excel in certain types of projects. They are suitable for simple pages, such as a personal profile page, information about a business or even a blog…. sites that do not really need the sort of functionality or complexity that comes with user interaction such as Facebook.  The advantages include greater performance compared to a dynamic site, and they make it much easier to insert and amend common code in multiple documents such as meta tags or global navigation.

I personally have enjoyed building this website using the Jekyll SSG.  There has been a bit of learning to do regarding Jekyll’s liquid templates and some new code, but the overall process has been really smooth (I won’t talk about using Docker for Windows with my Jekyll boilerplate in this post!). Ok, so I haven’t built my templates and such from scratch, but I think the concept of layouts, includes, front matter and assets are logical and easy to work with, and it has been easy to utilize the simple blog post compatibility as well as push the site to my Github Pages repo.  Adding new pages is a piece of cake and I think this SSG does what it should do… helps us create simple static websites with ease and speed.
