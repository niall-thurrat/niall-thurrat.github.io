title:  "What are robots.txt and humans.txt?"

I navigated to the [http://www.robotstxt.org](robotstxt.org) website to learn how to insert a robots.txt file into my website. It's quite simple to do really.... create a text file which sits in your top directory (or at least will be found by web robots at your webs URL with /robots.txt added) and add some code which instructs web robots if they have permission to scan your documents. From my basic understanding, there are useful robots such as those used by Google to index websites, and bad robots such as those used to search for security vunerabilities or email addresses for spamming purposes.  Unfortunately harmful web robots don't actually care about this text file and are not programmed to act on its code, but I've chosen to not allow any robots in the preferences of my file anyhow, as I'm not really interested in having google, or any other robot, scan the content of my website just now.

For to learn how about humans.txt files, I navigated to the very simple [http://humanstxt.org/](humanstxt.org/) website. This file is positioned in the same place as a robots.txt file and also has some simple code to show who the authors of the website are. The only thing that really required a bit of thought was who I should actually mention in this file. I made a rough attempt at giving credit to my teachers who had adapted the boilerplate and project, as well as Jekyll and SASS. I feel I could spend all week really digging into the actuall people behind helping make my site possible, so I hope mentioning orgaisations doesn't affend any specific contributers! 

I'm new to the whole robots and humans.txt files, so if you think I've put my foot in the wrong place please leave a comment!
