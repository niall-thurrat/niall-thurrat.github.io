title:  "What are robots.txt and humans.txt?"

I navigated to [http://www.robotstxt.org](robotstxt.org) to learn how to insert a robots.txt file into my website. It's quite simple to do really.... you simply need to create a text file which sits in your top directory (or at least will be found by web robots at your webs URL with /robots.txt added) and add some code which instructs web robots if they have permission to scan your documents. From my basic understanding, there's useful robots such as those used by Google to index websites, and bad robots such as those used to search for security vunerabilities or email addresses for spamming purposes.  Unfortunately harmful web robots don't actually care about this text file and are not programmed to act on its code, but I've chosen to not allow any robots in the preferences in my file anyhow, as I'm not really interested in have google, or any other robot, scan the content of my website just now.
